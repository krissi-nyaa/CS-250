# Essential Questions for software developers and my thoughts on them

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

When interpreting user needs, it's important to understand the problem or challenge that the user is facing. This involves asking questions such as "What is the user trying to achieve?" or "What pain points do they experience?" These are the key questions to ask when developing user storied. To implement these needs into a program, I create user stories that outline the specific functionality required. User stories are short descriptions of the features or requirements of a software program from the user's perspective. They help me focus on the end-user's needs and ensure that the program is designed to meet those needs. For example, a user story for a fitness app might be "As a runner, I want to track my distance, speed, and heart rate during my runs so that I can see my progress and set new challenges." By creating user stories, I can ensure that the program is tailored to the user's needs and provides a valuable experience.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When approaching software development, I will follow an agile methodology that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. Agile processes help me deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently by breaking down the development process into smaller, manageable chunks. I prioritize tasks based on user needs and work in short iterations to ensure that the program is constantly improving. Some of the agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work include Scrum ceremonies (such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives), pair programming, and CI/CD practicies. By using these processes, I can ensure that my programs are adaptable, scalable, and meet the evolving needs of users.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means being collaborative, communicative, and dependable. It involves working effectively with others towards a common goal, sharing knowledge and expertise, and being open to feedback and suggestions. Some specific qualities that I strive for as a team member include active listening, empathy, appreciating diverse inputs, and adaptability. I also prioritize building strong relationships with my colleagues by fostering trust and respect. By being a good team member, I can contribute to the success of the project and create a positive working environment for everyone involved. Additionally, I believe that being a good team member is essential for delivering high-quality software that meets user needs and exceeds expectations.
